# COOK
An overpower wordlist generator, splitter, merger, finder, saver, create words permutation and combinations, apply different encoding/decoding and everything you need.  

Frustration killer! & Customizable!

### Customizable
Cook is highly customizable and it depends on
[cook-ingredients](https://github.com/glitchedgitz/cook-ingredients). Cook Ingredients consists YAML Collection of word-sets, extensions, funcitons to generate pattern and wordlists.

### Installation
Use Go or download [latest builds](https://github.com/glitchedgitz/cook/releases/)  
```
go install -v github.com/glitchedgitz/cook/v2/cmd/cook@latest
```

> After installation, run `cook` for one time, it will download [cook-ingredients](https://github.com/glitchedgitz/cook-ingredients) automatically at `%USERPROFILE%/cook-ingredients` for windows and `$home/cook-ingredients` for linux.

# Basic
Without basics, everything is useless.
<img src="assets/basic.png">

## Parametric Approach
You can define your own params and use them to generate the pattern. This will be useful once you understand [methods](#methods)
<img src="assets/parameterapproach.png">

# Save wordlists and word sets
<img src="assets/savewordlist.png">

### Search Wordlist
```
cook search keyword
```

## Reading File using Cook
If you want to use a file from current working directory.  
Use `:` after param name. 
```
cook -f: live.txt f
```

# Methods
Methods will let you apply diffenent sets of operation on final output or particular column as you want. You can encode, decode, reverse, split, sort, extract different part of urls and much more...

- `-m/-method` to apply methods on the final output
- `-mc/-methodcol` to apply column-wise.
- `param.methodname` apply to any parameter-wise, will example this param thing later.
- `param.md5.b64e` apply multiple methods, this will first md5 hash the value and then base64 encode the hashed value.

## Multiple Methods
You can apply multiple set of operations on partiocular column or final output in one command. So you don't have to re-run the tool again and again.

To understanding the usage, suppose you read a blog, consider this one https://blog.assetnote.io/2020/09/18/finding-hidden-files-folders-iis-bigquery/.

```
cook -z shub_zip_files z.json[path].fb.sortu.smartjoin[c:_]
```

<img src="./assets/multiplemethods.png">

# Direct fuzzing with FUFF
You can use generated output from cook directly with [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) using pipe

```
cook usernames_list : passwords_list -m b64e | ffuf -u https://target.com -w - -H "Authorization: Basic FUZZ"
```

Similarly you can fuzz directories/headers/params/numeric ids... And can apply required algorithms on your payloads.

# Functions
```
cook -dob date[17,Sep,1994] elliot _,-, dob
```
<img src="./assets/functions.png">

> Customize:    
 Create your own functions in `cook-ingredients/my.yaml` under functions:

# Parsing Rules
|  |  |
|---|---|
|Columns| Separated by space |
|Values| Separated by comma |
|Params| You can give param any name, use `-` before anything to make it param `-param value` |
|Raw Strings| Use ` before and after the string to stop cook's parsing. Useful when you need to use any keyword as a word. |
|Pipe Input| Take pipe input using `-` as value of any param. |
|File Input| Use `:` after param name to take file input. `cook -f: live.txt f`|
|Functions | Can be called using params only. |
|Methods | Can be used on params or on final output |

# Flags
| Flag | Usage |
|---|---|
|-a, -append| Append to the previous lines, instead of permutations |
|-c, -col| Print column numbers and there values |
|-conf, -config| Config Information |
|-mc, -methodcol| Apply methods column wise  `-mc 0:md5,b64e; 1:reverse` <br> To all cols separate  `-mc md5,b64e` |
|-m, -method| Apply methods to final output |
|-h, -help| Help |
|-min | Minimum no of columns to print |

### -append
Append line by line. So basically if you want to merge two lists line by line. Then use it. And as always you can append multiple columns using column
<img src="./assets/append.png"> 

### -min
<img src="./assets/min.png">

# Ranges
Something useful...
<img src="./assets/ranges.png">

# Repeat Operator
You can repeat a string horizontally or vertically.
- Use `*` for horizontal repeating.
- Use `**` for vertical repeating.
- And try this `*10-1` or this `*1-10`.
- Create Null Payloads and directly fuzz with fuff. `cook **100 | fuff ...`

# Breaking Changes in version v2.x.x
Version 1.6 and Version 2 have signifant breaking changes to improe the usability of the tool.

- Previously columns was separated with colon. Now they are separated by space
- Single cook.yaml file removed. Now there is folder.
- URL support for yaml file and added sources with over 5500 wordlist sets.
- File regex removed, now use .regex[] method for regex
- Taking file input needs colon after param
- -case flag removed, now you can use upper, lower and title
- Added Methods
- Removed charset and extensions, now they are in list
- Simplyfied ranges

# Contribute
- Add wordlists, wordsets, functions, ports and other things in [cook-ingredients](https://github.com/glitchedgitz/cook-ingredients)
- Making **raw string** works like as it works in programming languages. Means better parser.
- I don't know, you might use your creativity and add some awesome features.
